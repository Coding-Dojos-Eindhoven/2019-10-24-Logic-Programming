## Intro (from invitation)

We know object-oriented programming, imperative programming, we have even done
functional programming, but there is also “logic programming”. Intuitively this
means that you specify a set of criteria that the solution has to satisfy, and
then let the computer come up with the solution(s). In this coding dojo we will
dip our toes into logic programming. A well-known language for that is Prolog,
but we will use Clojure for this. Don’t worry if you don’t know anything about
Clojure, we’ll start from the beginning.
